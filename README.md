# Sorting Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms. It serves as resource for tutorials and educational content focused on understanding and implementing fundamental algorithms. As new tutorials are created, this repository will be updated with corresponding code examples.

## Algorithms Implemented (Currently)

* **Bubble Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
* **Insertion Sort:** A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly inserting a value into the sorted part of the list.
* **Merge Sort:** An efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
* **Quick Sort:** An efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
* **Selection Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning.
* **Heap Sort**: An efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It builds a heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracts the largest (or smallest) element to build the sorted array.


## Coming Soon

Expect implementations of the following sorting algorithms to be added as new tutorials are released:

* Radix Sort
* Bucket Sort
* Counting Sort

## Contribution

While this repository primarily serves as a resource for learning, contributions and suggestions are welcome! If you find any issues or have ideas for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Stay Updated
